# Penis analysis - SFW
A beginning data scientist approaches data about the effects on measurement inflation when self measuring versus clinical measurement of the male genitalia.

This project idea was initially a joke made on Discord, but after realizing it would be a good practice with the potential for interesting results, I decided to see if anything came of it.
I hope this can serve as both a good laugh for my friends and as a way to track my learning progress in data science in the future, if I am able to abstract myself from the fact that ultimately, this is about the male reproductive organ.
